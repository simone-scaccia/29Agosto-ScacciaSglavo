Immunotherapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

In recent years, immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, work by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 interactions, reactivating the antitumor immune response.

Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, is indicated as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 expression â‰¥ 50% and without EGFR or ALK mutations. Efficacy is assessed by the tumor proportion score (TPS), calculated using immunohistochemistry.

Response to immunotherapy may be accompanied by immune-mediated side effects, such as pneumonitis, colitis, and endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, thyroiditis), which require monitoring and, in some cases, treatment with corticosteroids.

NCCN and ESMO guidelines include immunotherapy as the standard of care for NSCLC in various settings (first-line, maintenance, relapsed), often in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy.
